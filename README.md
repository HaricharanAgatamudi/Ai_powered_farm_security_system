**AI Powered Farm Security System for detecting and deterring Trespassers**
This project aims to develop an advanced system that utilizes deep learning and computer vision to detect birds and animals near farms or prawn rivers, providing an effective and eco-friendly solution to protect crops and resources.
The system incorporates a camera to capture real-time video feeds, which are processed using state-of-the-art object detection algorithms such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN. 
These algorithms are known for their high accuracy and speed in detecting objects within video frames, making them suitable for real-time applications.
The detected objects are classified into categories like birds, dogs, and other animals using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models like YOLOv8.
Upon successful detection, the system triggers an alarm to unauthorized humans, birds, and animals from entering the farm. 
To enhance accuracy, the system employs data augmentation techniques to handle variations in lighting, weather conditions, and animal appearances.
The integration of solar panels ensures the system is energy-efficient and suitable for deployment in remote areas with limited access to power.
This automated solution significantly reduces the need for manual monitoring, offering reliable, real-time protection for farms.
Its robust design, coupled with the use of secure cloud-based data storage and processing, ensures scalability and long-term sustainability.
This system represents a transformative step toward smarter and more sustainable farm management.
